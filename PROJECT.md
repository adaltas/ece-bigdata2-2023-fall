# Big Data 2 project

## Subjects

The project has to focus on **distributed systems**. It can either be:

1. **Answers to the following questions** regarding the labs Cloudera Data Platform and MinIO-Trino. The question B applies only to Cloudera lab, while the questions A and C-F to both labs.
  
  A) Draw a schema of the architecture ([schema example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/images/enterprise-bi-adf.png)).      
  B) What was in .json and .jar files that you imported?   
  C) Which tools were used for which task?   
  D) Which tools for the same category of tasks do you know? If you need a recall, check out the Git repository from Big Data course.   
  E) What are their similarities and differences? Make the tables with the comparison.   
  F) Give example of use cases where you explain why you would choose one over the other.
  
2. An **architecture/design project**, meaning that you will design a platform based on distributed systems for a particular use case. You will only write a project report that includes:
  - **Detailed description** of the use case
  - Presentation of all the technologies involved (at least 3)
  - Global architecture of the project (what technology for what part, interconnections between technologies, schema)
  - The important thing here is to **explain why you picked a particular technology**, what other technologies were considered
  - **Example**: Uber wants to track all its drivers in real-time in order to predict the areas most likely to be in need for drivers (what technologies will be used to: transport data, store data, analyse data, present results, etc.)
  
Expected format for the report: PDF
